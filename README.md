This repository contains example code for a tutorial covering jUnit4, Hamcrest and Mockito.
The examples include basic jUnit test definition, how to handle expected exceptions, timeouts, ignore test cases and how to create parameterized test cases. It provides a simple introduction to Hamcrest and how to create custom Hamcrest matchers. It also contains an introduction to Mockito by properly rewriting test from a real open-source project using mocks.
